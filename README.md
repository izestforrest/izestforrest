## Hi, I'm Zesty!
I'm new here, and am learning HTML and CSS (self-taught). I practice CSS using site skins on AO3 as my personal playground.
### AO3 Site Skin Project: Rainbow Reversi
My vision is to create various versions of the Reversi (dark mode) skin, but in color! I currently have over 11 palettes in progress:
- Dark Magenta `#331133`
- Sea Green `#16332e`
- Teal `#112833`
- Royal Blue `#111a33`
- Indigo Blue `#201f34`
- Indigo Purple `#1c1133`
- Purple `#ddd41f`
- Dark Pink `#2a0e1a`
- Green `#002200`
- Rust Red `#dd5555`
- Burnt Orange `#3e1c0b`

These skins aren't *just* the Reversi CSS code with the hex values edited; I have also made several small aesthetic and quality of life changes. I don't believe any of these changes will be super noticeable to the average viewer, but if you have any questions or recommendations, please let me know! If you want to see what my changes look like on a monochromatic palette, I will soon have a skin uploaded here that is the **original Reversi color palette** with all my customizations on it.
